GenMeta
=======

Genesis metasprite utility.

Given a PNG frame, properly paletted, this util lets you place Genesis
sprites on top, building a metasprite. There are algorithms, but at
this kind of task humans tend to do better.

Usage
-----

Arrow keys change the current tool.

To move a sprite, use the move tool, or select a sprite from the list.
To delete a sprite, click outside the image borders when moving.

When all non-background pixels are covered, the grey background turns green.
